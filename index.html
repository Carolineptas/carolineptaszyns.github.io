  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>I'm an Honours <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/Home/">Computer Engineering</a> student at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> currently in my 4th year.  My next co-op work term will run from September 2014 to December 2014.</p>
  <p>Recently I've become quite interested in web development, and have really enjoyed working on the front-end side.  I have experience developing all kinds of software, and love learning new things.</p>
  <p>This website currently exists to accompany my resume, however I plan to add much more to it in the future.</p>
  <p>Please feel free to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#97;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#117;&#119;&#97;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#111;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#97;">email</a> me with any questions or comments.</p>
