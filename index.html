  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>I'm an Honours <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/Home/">Computer Engineering</a> student at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> in my final year.  I am currently on my 6th co-op term, and expect to graduate in Spring 2015.</p>

  <p>Recently I've become quite interested in web development, and have really enjoyed working on the front-end side.  I have experience developing all kinds of software, and love learning new things.</p>
  <p>This website currently exists to accompany my resume, however I plan to add much more to it in the future.</p>
  <p>Please feel free to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#97;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#117;&#119;&#97;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#111;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#97;">email</a> me with any questions or comments.</p>
